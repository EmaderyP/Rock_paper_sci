### Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The user can input their choice (`'r'` for rock, `'p'` for paper, or `'s'` for scissors), and the computer will randomly select its choice. The program then determines the winner based on the game's rules.

How It Works:
1. The user is prompted to enter their choice (`'r'`, `'p'`, or `'s'`).
2. The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
3. The program checks if the user's choice beats the computer's choice using the game's rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors (`r > s`)
   - Paper beats Rock (`p > r`)
   - Scissors beat Paper (`s > p`)
4. The result is displayed as either a tie, a win for the user, or a loss.

Dependencies:
- Python's built-in `random` module is used for the computer's random choice.
